## NBA Sports Betting Model

This is a personal project that I built to try and beat the sports betting market using a Mulitple Linear Regression Model with predictors I found to be important when making a bet on a certain statistic. I used the NBA API to access historical data to feed my model a training set and a testing set to see the variability in its predicitons. While simple, it's deepend my understanding in Machine Learning and I hope to learn more. Included in this post is the repository and instructions on how to use it. At the moment, it's unfinished as I still need to make a lightweight frontend and a system that allows users to pick which statistic on a player they would like to predict. As it's still in it's testing phase, the way to find certain statstics right now is hardcoded. I'm currently testing the model and adding more predictor variables to explain more of the variance I'm expriencing in the current model.
