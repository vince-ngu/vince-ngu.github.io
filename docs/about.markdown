Hi there!

My name is Vince Nguyen and I'm a recent UC Berkeley graduate (Spring 2024) that majored in Environmental Economics and Policy. If you're reading this, you must be wondering, 
"Why is this guy trying to go into tech? Isn't he a tree-lover and a cap-and-trade enthusiast?" While that may be true, I didn't have a strong resonance with what I was studying.

It wasn't until late in my college career that I found a love and passion for problem solving after taking the infamous 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class. 
I truly enjoyed how they forced us to think outside the box, in a way that made you go "wow, this makes no sense and complete sense at the same time." I was enamoured by everything
that software development had to offer society- from something has simple as a password generator (my first personal project!) to AI Integration in what seems like everything.

Software development has so much potential and I'm only getting started on my journey to becoming a better software engineer! Come along with me C:
