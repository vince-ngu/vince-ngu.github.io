Hi there!

My name is Vince Nguyen and I'm a recent UC Berkeley graduate (Spring 2024) that majored in Environmental Economics and Policy. If you're reading this, you must be wondering
why I'm trying to break into the tech industry! Well, it wasn't until late in my college career that I found a love and passion for problem solving after taking the infamous
61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class. I truly enjoyed how they forced us to think outside the box, in a way that made you go "wow, this makes no sense
and complete sense at the same time."
